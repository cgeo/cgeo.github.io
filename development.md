### Our website

Like our source code also this website is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo.github.io).

We are also looking for people willing to help writing a users manual for c:geo. Just contact us via Github if you are interested.

## Nightly Builds

If you want to test new features of upcoming versions, you can use our nightly builds. These are current development snapshots, which you have to install manually on your device.

Nightly builds are not for live usage. You should only install these versions if you know what you're doing. These versions may not be stable. The features and changes are in alpha or beta state!

If you install one of our nightly builds to your device, you will not get support for failures, errors, functionality or crashes.

The version without JIT is necessary for some devices with a MediaTek CPU. If you observe strange behavior in the Live Map or jumping distances, try this build.
