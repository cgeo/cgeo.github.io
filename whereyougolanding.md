This is a prelimiary homepage for WhereYouGo. In fact it is only a subpage of the c:geo homepage for the time being, don't be confused by that.
A proper homepage is not yet existing, you are welcome to help creating it. Just contact us at [whereyougo@cgeo.org](mailto:whereyougo@cgeo.org?subject=WhereYouGo-Homepage).

## About WhereYouGo

WhereYouGo is an unofficial client for Wherigo Geocaching. It uses offline vector maps, alternatively Locus can be used to display maps.

## Current development status

The development of WhereYouGo was no longer continued by the last open source development team. After contacting the original author, the c:geo team has been able to take over the source code to make it available again for the open source community to allow further bugfixing and enhancement of WhereYouGo.
In a first step we managed to fix the download function for cartridges, thus restoring the original functionality.

For further development however we need help of the Geocaching community:
If you are interested to further improve WhereYouGo and have some knowledge of Java, check out the [new WhereYouGo repository](https://github.com/cgeo/WhereYouGo) or send us a mail to [whereyougo@cgeo.org](mailto:whereyougo@cgeo.org?subject=WhereYouGo-Development).
