# Now available: c:geo Pro

We worked hard for many months. We converted lots of coffee into code. We slept only every second night. Even the NSA wondered what we do. But now it is done: **Starting with 1st April 2016 we offer a pro version of c:geo!**


## Features in the pro version

Not only that you support the development with buying the app. The pro version also includes some additional features compared to the free version:

- Show final coordinates of all caches
- Increased GPS accuracy up to 5 cm
- Stealth mode: c:geo can hide you from the views of muggles¹
- Beta tester: Show unpublished caches

With a monthly subscription of only $4.99 you'll get the most wanted features:

- Lock a cache for 24 hours so that you have enough time for the FTF.
- Find caches without leaving the house. Just tap a button in c:geo and it will do the rest!


## Get it now!

The regular price for *c:geo pro* is $7.99, but for a short time it will be available for **only $3.99**, so [get it now](pro_get)!
