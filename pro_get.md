# April Fool!

Sorry to disappoint you! We hoped it was clear that these features cannot be true.

Back in 2011 c:geo was made open source. One of our goal was that c:geo will be free forever. And we'll keep this promise! There will be only one version of c:geo which receives all new features and bugfixes and that version will always be free.

Follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/android.geocaching), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/android_gc) or [GitHub](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo) to stay updated. If you want to support us, share c:geo with your friends, suggest new features, report bugs or help us coding.
